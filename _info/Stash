Stash

Items that a person owns, cannot be directly given to other members of their teams, but can instead be deposited in the team stash using the command `!stash store <item>`, from where it can be taken and used by any member of the team using the `!stash take` command. 
All auction items also go to the team stash once received. Sharing of items can be useful in many cases.
