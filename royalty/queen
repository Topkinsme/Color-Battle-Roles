Queen - (6)
- If the King dies, a living Queen will become the new King. Prince takes priority over Queen if both are alive.
- Upon death, if the cause of death is anything other than tribute, the Chief Warrior of their team (or the Monarch, or the senate) will gain an extra attack the following night.
- The queen will additionally also be provided with the name of her attacker.
- This ability will only work once per game.
- Respawns in 2 phases as a Queen, cannot respawn as a King.
