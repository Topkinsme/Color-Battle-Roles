Forge

Your team's main source of income comes from the forge. Every time a phase changes, every member of your team will get 100*<Your forge level> amount of cash. 
The forge level can be accessed by using `!force view` and you can use `!forge upgrade` to upgrade it! Doing this is very useful in the long run. 
Note that solo roles get a level 7 forge from the start.
