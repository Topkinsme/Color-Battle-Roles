Role_items

There are certain items in the game, which are unobtainable, except by specific roles. That is, items that some roles get due to a certain role power.
These items are not placed in the player's inventory, and are instead kept track of by the hosts.
The usage of such items can be blocked by role blocks, both soft and hard, except if the role mentions that the item usage cannot be roleblocked.
