Cult Leader- SOLO -
- The cult leader leads their own team that wants to end all other teams in the name of peace.
- At the start of the game, they have (players/3, rounded down) curses. They can mark any person in-game for the cost of a curse. 
- When a person with a curse dies, the person instead of dying joins the cult leader's team. This does not work if the death is due to the tribute, but the curse will not be removed in this case.
- The added person is now on the cult's team and has the same win goal as the cult leader (The cult leader is now their new leader). The converted people still have access to the old team chats and buildings.
- The added person will not lose their abilities and will still have access to their old team chat.
- If a king is converted, they still act as a king to their own team, but their allegiance lies with the Cult Leader. If a solo was supposed to be converted, the conversion will fail, and the curse is removed from the game.
- The cult leader can cast a curse once a phase. During the night, the curse is cast after all the kills.
- No one can respawn after they join the cult. The old king is irrelevant after they join the new team.
- Can't respawn. Wins if the cult is the only team alive.
