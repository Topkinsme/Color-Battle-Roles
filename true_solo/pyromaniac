Pyromaniac- SOLO
- Has the ability to powder 2 people every night, or powder 1 person and light everyone on fire.
- Lighting everyone on fire will cause all powdered people to get weak attacked. This also removed the powdered effect from all powdered people.
- Powerding a person is a night end effect. Powdering is not a visit. Powdering someone is before igniting.
- When there are less than 4 powdered people, the pyromaniac has night protection for free.
- Wins if they are the last person alive.
- Does not respawn.
