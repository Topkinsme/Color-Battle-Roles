Gunslinger - ()
- After the first night, may choose to mark an extra person or to kill all marked targets. This does not affect the factional kill.
- The player that has been marked will not be notified. 
- When the Gunslinger kills all their marked targets, he will perform a weak attack on every target. All targets will then be unmarked. They will visit every player they have marked.
- Does not respawn.

- Nerf (unsure if this role might be too OP): Performing either one of the actions will add a 2 phase cooldown to both abilities.
