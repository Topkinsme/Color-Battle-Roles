Berserker - ()
- After the first two nights, may choose to rampage at someone's house. This is independant to the faction kill.
- Rampaging will attack the target and anyone who visits them. Each kill rewards 3000. When the Berserker rampages, they will lose their strong protection (if they had strong protection).
- Rampage has a 6 phase cooldown and is a strong attack on the target, and a weak attack to any visitors.
- Does not respawn.
