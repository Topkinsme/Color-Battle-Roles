Gunslinger- ()
- After the first night, may choose to mark an extra person or to kill all marked targets. This does not affect the factional kill.
- The player that has been marked will not be notified.
- When the Gunslinger kills all their marked targets, he will perform a weak attack on every target. All targets will then be unmarked. They will visit every player they have marked.
- If marked players are killed, they will keep their mark, even if the Gunslinger attacks their marked targets while they are respawning.
- Performing either one of the actions will add a 2 phase cooldown to both abilities.
- Does not respawn.
