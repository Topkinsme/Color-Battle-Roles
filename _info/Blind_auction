Blind Auction

Every day, a powerful item will be for sale in the #auction_house. 
This item can be purchased by any team by winning the auction. You can use `!auction blind bid <code> <cost>` to bid for the item, using the code from the auction_house. 
If you bid higher than all other bidders, you win that item. These items are powerful and can change the flow of the game if used well.
