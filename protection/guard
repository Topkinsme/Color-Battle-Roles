Guard- (5)
- Can protect someone from all attacks at all times. They will die instead of the person they protect. 
  - The first time the Guard's target is Strong Attacked, only the Guard will die. Every time after that, both the target and the Guard will die.
  - Cannot change their target after initially picking it (Unless target somehow dies before guard).
  - When the guard dies instead of its target, the killers visit is not redirected into having visted the guard.
- The guard cannot be role-blocked. The guard is the last layer of protection, any other protection will be used before this.
- Action is night end. Counts as a visiting action.
- Respawns in 4 phases.
