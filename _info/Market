Market

Not to be mistaken for the Stock market, this market holds a variety of useful items for anyone to use, which can drastically change the situation. But since these items are really powerful, they are behind a heavy paywall. 
Use `!market view` to check it out. You can use `!market level` to check your market level. You need to use `!market upgrade` to upgrade your market. Use `!market buy` to buy the desired items. 
Only people alive have access to the market. Once in the respawning phase, the market is replaced by a black market.
Note that Solos have the entire market unlocked for free. Also note that these items will only be used if you explicitly inform the hosts that you are using these items.
