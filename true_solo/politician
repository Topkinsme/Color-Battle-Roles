- They can use any of the powers that they have from previous buys with 1 order. All role conditions like cooldowns etc stil apply.
- They can also choose to execute any person they have previously investigated (bought) with 2 orders. This will perform an strong attack on them.
- Executing a person will also make the politician lose this person's role that they bought, and the politician will need to buy the person again to use the role.
