Musician- (6)
- Has the ability to sing a melody to anyone in game, during the day. This medoly makes them use their night actions on themselves.
- Has no effects if the target has a day action. If the target had no actions or was roleblocked, nothing happens.
- In these cases, the Musician does not use the ability and can use the ability again the next day.
- Once every game, can also sing a angry tune instead of the normal tune. 
- This will soft roleblock the role, and instead make them weak attack themselves. If the role cannot be role blocked, the angry tune is cancelled. The target is not informed that they are roleblocked.
- Singing to someone is a day end action. Singing to anyone is not a visiting action. Singing has a 2 day (4 phases) cooldown. Singing cannot be used on the same person twice in a row.
- Respawns in 4 phases.
