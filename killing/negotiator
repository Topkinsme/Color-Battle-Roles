Negotiator - (3)
- The negotiator can pick a target at any point, and if the negotiator is attacked, they will negotiate with the attacker to attack their target instead. 
- Redirecting a kill makes the killer visit the target instead of the negotiator.
- Once chosen, the negotiator cannot change targets unless the target dies before the ability is used.
- Redirecting an attack can only be performed once. They regain this ability on death.
- Action is immediate.
- Respawns in 4 phases.
